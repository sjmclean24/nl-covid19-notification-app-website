# Accessibility

<p class="md-block-lead md-text-color-RO-donkerblauw" markdown="1">
  The CoronaMelder app should be available for everyone. From its inception, accessibility has been taken into account with the help of professionals possessing the necessary experience and expertise. Still, the app might not be accessible to you. Are you unable to make use of the app as intended? Let us know by emailing <a href="mailto:coronamelder@minvws.nl">coronamelder@minvws.nl</a>.
</p>

The CoronaMelder app follows the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/) on level AA as set out in the European standard EN 301 549. Should this European standard be updated with specific guidelines for mobile applications, the required adjustments will be made to comply.

Detailed information about the app's accessibility can be found within the Accessibility Statement.
